# abstract-vs-concrete-multimedia-learning

## Overview
This project investigates how the **abstractness of multimedia texts** influences **learning outcomes**.  
In a controlled experiment, participants (N = 64) read two texts supplemented with pictures:

- **Concrete text**: yoga asanas  
- **Abstract text**: Nash equilibrium  

After reading, participants completed a **knowledge assessment** consisting of five tasks of increasing difficulty:

1. Recognition  
2. Verification  
3. Transfer  
4. Concept Definition  
5. Summary  

## Research Question
Do multimedia learning outcomes differ depending on text abstractness?  
Are these differences consistent across the various test tasks?

## Methods
To capture both systematic effects and individual variability, the analysis employs **linear mixed-effects models (LMMs)**.  
This approach allows us to evaluate differences across tasks while accounting for participant-level variation.

## How to Reproduce
- Clone the repository  
- Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- Run the notebook in `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`
